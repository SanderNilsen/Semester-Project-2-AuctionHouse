# Semester-Project-2-Auction House

For this project, I have been tasked with developing a fully functional auction site. The platform will allow users to buy and sell items using a credit-based system. New users will receive 1,000 credits upon registration, which they can use to bid on items. Additional credits can be earned by selling items through the platform.

### Key Features:
* User Registration & Authentication – New users receive 1,000 credits upon signing up.
* Auction Listings – Both registered and non-registered users can browse available listings.
* Bidding System – Only registered users can place bids on items.
* Credit System – Users can earn credits by selling items and spend them on purchases.

### Technology Stack:
* Frontend Design: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/AX1ZyCJTAK4SBQInwqgZ6N/Semester-Project-2---Auction-Site?node-id=0-1&t=zdShkMUShuaRUpCk-1) (for wireframe & prototyping)
* CSS Framework: [TailwindCSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli) (to explore a new framework beyond Bootstrap)
